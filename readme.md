# Comprehensive Code Comparison Repository

Welcome to the Comprehensive Code Comparison Repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of code samples written in various programming languages. The purpose is to help developers compare and contrast the syntax, structure, and implementation of different programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each programming language has its own folder named after the language (e.g., `python`, `r`, `ruby`, `c`, `javascript`).
- Within each language folder, you will find code files written in that specific language, represented by their respective file extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.r`, `.rb`, `.c`, `.js`).
- Additionally, there are overarching `.md` (Markdown) files that showcase examples of code snippets written in multiple languages. These files are named after their specific purpose (e.g., `helloworld.md`).
