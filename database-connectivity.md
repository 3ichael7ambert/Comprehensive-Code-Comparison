# Database Connectivity in Different Programming Languages

In this markdown file, we will explore how to establish database connectivity in various programming languages. Database connectivity is crucial for interacting with databases, performing operations such as retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

## Python

Python provides multiple libraries for connecting to databases, with the most popular being **`Python DB API`**. Here's an example of establishing a connection to a MySQL database using the `mysql-connector-python` library:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establishing a connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='username', password='password',
                              host='localhost', database='database_name')

# Perform database operations

# Closing the connection
cnx.close()
```

## JavaScript

In JavaScript, database connectivity can be achieved using libraries specific to the database or using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library. Here's an example of connecting to a MongoDB database using the `mongodb` driver:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'database_name';

// Create a new MongoClient
const client = new MongoClient(url);

// Connect to the server
client.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Connected successfully to MongoDB');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  // Perform database operations

  // Closing the connection
  client.close();
});
```

## Java

Java provides a standard API, **`Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)`**, for connecting to databases. Here's an example of connecting to a MySQL database using JDBC:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/database_name";
        String username = "username";
        String password = "password";

        try {
            // Establishing a connection
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password);

            // Perform database operations

            // Closing the connection
            connection.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Ruby

In Ruby, database connectivity can be achieved using libraries specific to the database or using an ORM library. Here's an example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database using the `pg` gem:

```ruby
require 'pg'

# Connection details
conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'database_name', user: 'username', password: 'password', host: 'localhost')

# Perform database operations

# Closing the connection
conn.close
```

## C++

C++ does not have a built-in database connectivity library. Instead, you can use third-party libraries like **`MySQL Connector/C++`** or **`SQLite Modern C++`** to establish database connections.

```cpp
#include <mysql_driver.h>
#include <mysql_connection.h>

int main() {
    sql::mysql::MySQL_Driver *driver;
    sql::Connection *con;

    // Creating a connection
    driver = sql::mysql::get_mysql_driver_instance();
    con = driver->connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:3306", "username", "password");

    // Perform database operations

    // Closing the connection
    delete con;

    return 0;
}
```

## PHP

In PHP, database connectivity is straightforward due to its built-in support for various databases. Here's an example of connecting to a MySQL database using the `mysqli` extension:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost

";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "database_name";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";

// Perform database operations

// Closing the connection
$conn->close();
?>
```

These examples demonstrate the basic steps to establish database connectivity in different programming languages. The specific libraries and methods may vary depending on the database system you are connecting to. Make sure to refer to the documentation of the respective libraries or APIs for detailed usage instructions.

Happy coding!
