# Initialization in Different Programming Languages

In this markdown file, you will find information about initialization in various programming languages, including any special requirements or conventions for file downloading, file naming, or additional dependencies.

## Python

- **File Extension**: `.py`
- **Dependencies**: Python interpreter (usually pre-installed on most systems)
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and underscores for Python file names (e.g., `my_script.py`)

## R

- **File Extension**: `.R`
- **Dependencies**: R interpreter (usually pre-installed on most systems)
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and underscores for R file names (e.g., `my_script.R`)

## Ruby

- **File Extension**: `.rb`
- **Dependencies**: Ruby interpreter (may need to be installed on your system)
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and underscores for Ruby file names (e.g., `my_script.rb`)

## C

- **File Extension**: `.c`
- **Dependencies**: C compiler (such as GCC) needs to be installed on your system
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and underscores for C file names (e.g., `my_program.c`)

## JavaScript

- **File Extension**: `.js`
- **Dependencies**: JavaScript is usually executed within a web browser or using a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js)
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and dashes for JavaScript file names (e.g., `my-script.js`)

## Java

- **File Extension**: `.java`
- **Dependencies**: Java Development Kit (JDK) needs to be installed on your system
- **File Naming Convention**: The Java file name must match the public class name declared within the file. For example, if the class name is `MyClass`, the file name should be `MyClass.java`.

## Swift

- **File Extension**: `.swift`
- **Dependencies**: Xcode (for macOS and iOS development) or Swift compiler (can be installed separately on other systems)
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word for Swift file names (e.g., `MyClass.swift`)

## PHP

- **File Extension**: `.php`
- **Dependencies**: PHP interpreter needs to be installed on your system
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and underscores for PHP file names (e.g., `my_script.php`)

## Go

- **File Extension**: `.go`
- **Dependencies**: Go compiler needs to be installed on your system
- **File Naming Convention**: Go follows a convention where the file name should match the package name declared within the file. For example, if the package name is `main`, the file name should be `main.go`.

## Kotlin

- **File Extension**: `.kt` (for Kotlin source code) or `.kts` (for Kotlin scripts)
- **Dependencies**: Kotlin compiler needs to be installed on your system
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention required, but it's common to use lowercase letters and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word for Kotlin file names (e.g., `MyClass.kt`)

## Rust

- **File Extension**: `.rs`
- **Dependencies**: Rust compiler needs to be installed on your system
- **File Naming Convention**: No specific naming convention
