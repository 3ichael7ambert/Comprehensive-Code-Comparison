# Variable Manipulation in Different Programming Languages

In this markdown file, you will find examples of variable manipulation in various programming languages. Each programming language has its own syntax and conventions for manipulating variables, such as assigning values, performing arithmetic operations, and modifying their contents.

## Python

```python
# Variable assignment
x = 5
y = 3

# Arithmetic operations
sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

# Modifying variable contents
x += 1
y -= 1
```

## R

```r
# Variable assignment
x <- 5
y <- 3

# Arithmetic operations
sum <- x + y
difference <- x - y
product <- x * y
quotient <- x / y

# Modifying variable contents
x <- x + 1
y <- y - 1
```

## Ruby

```ruby
# Variable assignment
x = 5
y = 3

# Arithmetic operations
sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

# Modifying variable contents
x += 1
y -= 1
```

## C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Variable assignment
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;

    // Arithmetic operations
    int sum = x + y;
    int difference = x - y;
    int product = x * y;
    int quotient = x / y;

    // Modifying variable contents
    x += 1;
    y -= 1;

    return 0;
}
```

## JavaScript

```javascript
// Variable assignment
let x = 5;
let y = 3;

// Arithmetic operations
let sum = x + y;
let difference = x - y;
let product = x * y;
let quotient = x / y;

// Modifying variable contents
x += 1;
y -= 1;
```

## Java

```java
public class VariableManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Variable assignment
        int x = 5;
        int y = 3;

        // Arithmetic operations
        int sum = x + y;
        int difference = x - y;
        int product = x * y;
        int quotient = x / y;

        // Modifying variable contents
        x += 1;
        y -= 1;
    }
}
```

## Swift

```swift
// Variable assignment
var x = 5
var y = 3

// Arithmetic operations
let sum = x + y
let difference = x - y
let product = x * y
let quotient = x / y

// Modifying variable contents
x += 1
y -= 1
```

## PHP

```php
// Variable assignment
$x = 5;
$y = 3;

// Arithmetic operations
$sum = $x + $y;
$difference = $x - $y;
$product = $x * $y;
$quotient = $x / $y;

// Modifying variable contents
$x += 1;
$y -= 1;
```

## Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Variable assignment
    x := 5
    y := 3

    // Arithmetic operations
    sum := x + y
    difference := x - y
    product := x * y
    quotient := x / y

    // Modifying variable contents
    x += 1
    y -= 1


}
```

## Kotlin

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Variable assignment
    var x = 5
    var y = 3

    // Arithmetic operations
    val sum = x + y
    val difference = x - y
    val product = x * y
    val quotient = x / y

    // Modifying variable contents
    x += 1
    y -= 1
}
```

## Rust

```rust
fn main() {
    // Variable assignment
    let x = 5;
    let y = 3;

    // Arithmetic operations
    let sum = x + y;
    let difference = x - y;
    let product = x * y;
    let quotient = x / y;

    // Modifying variable contents
    let mut x = x;
    let mut y = y;
    x += 1;
    y -= 1;
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to manipulate variables in various programming languages. You can assign values to variables, perform arithmetic operations, and modify their contents as per the syntax and conventions of each programming language. Feel free to explore and experiment with these examples in your preferred programming language.

Happy coding!
